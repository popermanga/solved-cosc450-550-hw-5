1. Assume the following rules of associativity and precedence for expression:Precedence Highest *, /, not+, -, &amp;, mod-(unary)=, /=, &lt;. &lt;=, &gt;=, &gt;andLowest or, xorAssociativity Left to rightShow the order of evaluation of the following expressions by parenthesizing allsubexpressions and placing a superscript on the right parenthesis to indicate order. Forexample, for the expressiona + b * c + dthe order of evaluation would be represented as((a + (b * c)1)2 + d)3a. a * b – 1 + cb. a * (b – 1) / c mod dc. (a – b) / c &amp; (d * e / a – 3)d. –a or c = d and ee. a &gt; b xor c or d &lt;= 17f. –a + b2. Show the order of evaluation of the expressions of the above expressions, assuming thatthere are no precedence rules and all operators associate right to left.
